                <p><mark>Highlighted</mark> text is easy to achieve by using the
                    <mark>mark tag</mark>. Again, semantics are important.

                <p><s>Using an "S" tag inside a paragraph will strike the text
                        through, indicating that the text is no longer correct or accurate.</s></p>
                <p><del>Using the "DEL" tag has a similar effect to "S", but the
                        meaning is different, in that the text is to be or has been
                        deleted.</del></p>
                <p><small>The "SMALL" tag is mostly used for the small print, and
                        will be liked by legal folks :-)</small></p>
                <p><strong>And "STRONG" is used to make text bolder so it stands
                        out.</strong></p>
                <p><em>Whereas the "EM" tag is designed to emphasize text by making
                        it appear italic.</em></p>
                <p><u>The "U" tag will underline your text.</u></p>
                <p>And finally, "INS" is designed to make it look like text <ins>has
                        been inserted</ins> into a paragraph.</p>

                    Vokalia and
                    Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of
                    the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies
                    it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences
                    fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an
                    almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum
                    decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there
                    were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
                    didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the
                    way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the
                    skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own
                    road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then...</p>
                <p class="text-truncate">Truncate Text: The European languages are members of the same family. Their
                    separate
                    existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages
                    only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why
                    a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve
                    this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several
                    languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of
                    the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing
                    European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an
                    English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told
